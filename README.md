# CompilerBot

discord bot that runs my own programing language. It is this weird mix between python and c++ (was learning python while creating this bot). The compiler converts the code into python and runs it then returns the output. NOTE: THIS HAS A LOT OF FLAWS THAT I DIDN'T BOTHER FIXING SINCE IT IS A PERSONAL PROJECT (no run time limit etc).
