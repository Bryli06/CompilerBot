# SelfProjectsBot

This bot has 2 features so far: 
1. a discord bot that runs my own programing language. It is this weird mix between python and c++ (was learning python while creating this bot). The compiler converts the code into python and runs it then returns the output. NOTE: THIS HAS A LOT OF FLAWS THAT I DIDN'T BOTHER FIXING SINCE IT IS A PERSONAL PROJECT (no run time limit etc). 

2. nsfw image detection bot that uses yahoo's open nsfw model (https://github.com/yahoo/open_nsfw) but using tf since I don't know caffe
